## Finkraft AG-GRID CSS/HTML Assessment.

### Requirements:
1) Customize the default AG-GRID table (the table of the project) by creating a new CSS theme, use all your imagination to make it looks beautiful.
2) Add some more HTML elements around the table, like footer, header, sidebar, be free to use the structure you like, use all your ingenuity. 
3) You can use any css technique you are used to, is recommendable to use check AG-GRID theming documentation (find documentation [here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/themes/#top)) and follow their custom theme designing way in the end we might want to apply the style as new ag-grid theme.

### Project local setup:
1) In order to run this project locally you need to have installed nodejs after that install all node modules by running `npm install` and then run  `npm run start` and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). You will see a table there.

### Help
1) In order to apply new CSS code you should edit `public/static/css/ag-grid-custom-theme.css` this is included in `public/index.html` you may also want to edit this file by adding new HTML elements around the table element which is loaded inside root element.

### Documentaiton
1) We highly use AG-GRID table component from [here](https://www.ag-grid.com/)
2) Styling documentation of ag-grid component can be found [here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/themes/)
